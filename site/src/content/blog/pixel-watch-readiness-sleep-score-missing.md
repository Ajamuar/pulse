Start with the two rules Google states: readiness needs 7 nights of sleep wear before it first appears, and most metrics need at least 3 hours of quality sleep. A sleep score also needs recorded sleep stages. If you meet both and one is still missing, check fit, battery and sync, in that order.

## Which score is missing?

They have different requirements, so work out which one you mean.

| | Readiness | Sleep score |
|---|---|---|
| Where | Google Health app; Pixel Watch card | Sleep tab; Pixel Watch Sleep card |
| Needs | 7 nights of wear for a baseline, sleep of at least 3 hours | Sleep stages recorded for the night |
| Built from | HRV, recent sleep, resting heart rate | Six sleep measures, no HRV or resting heart rate |
| Appears | Within about 20 seconds of getting out of bed | After you wake and the watch syncs |

Both are listed by Google for the Pixel Watch family. The readiness page names Pixel Watch 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Google also lists Fitbit devices on the same page, but this post is about the watch on your wrist.

## 1. It is the first week

Google's wording: "you must wear your device for 7 nights of sleep to establish a personalized baseline." It also says to wear the device consistently for about a month for a more accurate baseline.

If the watch is new, or you have only just started wearing it to bed, nothing is wrong. Count nights actually worn to bed, and keep counting. A night without the watch, or one that was too short to record properly, may not count. Google does not say whether a missed night resets the count, only that you need 7 nights of sleep wear.

## 2. The sleep was too short, or too restless

The readiness score is calculated "approximately within 20 seconds of getting out of bed from a sleep of at least 3 hours". Google lists "too short or you moved a lot" among the reasons for no score. A night of 2 hours 40 minutes, or a bed you spent mostly awake in, is not going to produce one.

Short nights are also the usual cause of a missing HRV reading. HRV is one of the three readiness inputs, and Google's health metrics page says most metrics need "at least 3 hours of quality sleep". If HRV did not record, readiness is likely to follow. There is a separate checklist for that in [HRV zero or not tracked](/blog/fitbit-air-hrv-zero/).

## 3. No sleep stages for the night

For the sleep score, this is the commonest official reason. Google: "Your device must track sleep stages to generate a score. Without them, no score is produced." Reasons include:

- You did not wear it to bed, or it was on a charger.
- Battery ran out during the night. Google tells you to make sure there is enough battery for the entire intended sleep period.
- The watch was loose enough that the sensor lost contact.

Charging habits are worth a thought here. If your routine is to charge the watch overnight because the day was heavy, that is the night with no score.

## 4. Fit and wear

Google's list of reasons for a missing score includes: the back of the device not touching your skin. It says the band should be snug but not constricting. A loose strap is the first thing to rule out if scores come and go.

## 5. You edited the sleep log

Extending or editing your sleep times can produce a recalculated score that is less accurate or none at all. If you adjusted the time you fell asleep or woke up in the app and the score vanished, that is the likely reason, and Google does not offer a way to restore it.

## 6. Sync and the app

Open the Google Health app after waking and let it sync. The sleep score "may take a minute to appear". If you are using the watch's own card, Google says to open the Google Health app from the watch and swipe to the Sleep or Readiness card.

If nothing arrives, update the app, check the phone's Bluetooth connection and make sure background sync is not restricted for the app. These are general troubleshooting steps and not Google-specific guidance for this problem.

## 7. The score is there but shows 1 or 0

Google's readiness page contradicts itself. One sentence says the score "ranges from 0 (low) to 100 (high)", another says "from 1 to 100". The bands are Low 1 to 29, Moderate 30 to 64 and High 65 to 100. So a very low readiness number is not necessarily a missing one. Whether 0 is a real result or a placeholder is not explained, so if you see 0 or 1 after a normal night, check the fit and sleep length first, then look at the breakdown.

## What is a free feature and what is not

The readiness score itself is available without Premium. Premium adds a coach that, per the page, "proactively advises adjustments to your training based on your readiness score". The page does not spell out what a free user gets beyond the score, and Premium features vary by device and country. Premium is not the reason a score is missing.

## Where Pulse fits, and where it does not

Pulse is a free app you host yourself that reads data from the Google Health API and computes its own scores. That API has no readiness or sleep score field, so Pulse cannot show your Google numbers. It computes a separate Recovery and Sleep Performance from nightly HRV, resting heart rate and sleep data ([how Recovery works](/metrics/recovery/), [how Sleep Performance works](/metrics/sleep-performance/)).

One limit matters here. Pulse is built and tested with the Fitbit Air only. Pixel Watch data uses the same Google Health data types, but nobody has checked Pulse against a real Pixel Watch account, so I cannot promise it works.

## When none of this fixes it

If you have worn the watch properly for more than a fortnight with proper sleep and nothing appears, contact Google support, and mention the model, the app version and which nights have sleep stages in the Sleep tab. If you also have symptoms such as palpitations or unexplained exhaustion, a missing score is not the thing to worry about, and a doctor is the person to ask.
