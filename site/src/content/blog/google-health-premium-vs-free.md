Day to day, not much. Your scores, charts and history stay in the free app: steps, heart rate, sleep stages, Sleep Score, Daily Readiness, Cardio Load, HRV and SpO2. What you lose is the Gemini coach, adaptive plans, deeper sleep insights and a coach-set Target Load. If you never used those, day 91 of a Fitbit Air looks like day 89.

That's the short version. The longer one is mostly about the edges, because Google's help pages and the press coverage disagree in places, and the Fitbit-to-Google-Health rename mixed the old and new plans together.

## Why the question comes up on day 91

A Fitbit Air comes with three months of Google Health Premium, according to Google's launch post. So the first three months are a trial, and the useful comparison is not "free vs paid" but "what changes when the trial ends".

As of October 2026, Premium costs $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year in the US (Google's launch post says "$99 annually"; Droid Life and other outlets give $99.99). Prices differ by country, so check the app. Premium is also included at no extra charge in Google AI Pro ($19.99 a month) and Google AI Ultra. If you already pay for one of those, you may already have Premium and not know it.

## What stays free

Droid Life's May 2026 comparison lists the free "Basic" plan as including steps, Cardio Load, Readiness, sleep score, sleep schedules and stages, heart rate, HRV, SpO2, weight logging and nutrition and water logging. Google's own help pages back up the pieces I checked:

- **Sleep Score.** Google's Sleep Score page says you can see your daily score and the metrics behind it (duration, time to sound sleep, restlessness, interruptions) without Premium. You can also edit your sleep log and download your raw sleep data, "which comes without analysis".
- **Daily Readiness.** The help page describes the score as built from heart rate variability, recent sleep and resting heart rate. It doesn't mention a Premium requirement for the score itself. It does say Premium users get a coach that advises training adjustments based on it. Articles from before September 2024 put Readiness behind the paywall; the current pages don't.

```sketch
{"kind": "flow", "alt": "Daily Readiness is built from heart rate variability, recent sleep and resting heart rate", "inputs": ["Heart rate variability", "Recent sleep", "Resting heart rate"], "output": "Daily Readiness", "note": "0-100, 65 and above is High", "caption": "From Google Health Help. Free, no Premium needed."}
```
- **Cardio Load.** The help page's only free-versus-Premium difference is the weekly target (below). It lists nothing else that changes for the number itself.

Notice what "free" includes: the data. Google's Sleep Score page says you can download your raw sleep data without Premium, and the same watch readings are what the Google Health API serves to apps you authorise yourself.

## What Premium adds

Per Droid Life and 9to5Google, Premium adds:

- the Google Health Coach, a Gemini-powered assistant you can chat with
- adaptive fitness plans built around your goals
- deeper sleep insights, and the sleep coach (Google's Sleep Score page names these two)
- medical record summaries (reported as US only)
- proactive insights and an on-demand workout library

Google's help pages add that Premium features may vary by device and country, may be English only, and list a compatible Android device among the requirements. If you are on iPhone, check that before paying.

```

## The one change you'd notice: Target Load

This is the clearest free-versus-Premium difference in Google's own documentation. On the Cardio Load and Target Load page:

| | Without Premium | Premium, coach switched on |
|---|---|---|
| Weekly Target Load | Follows your average Cardio Load over the previous 4 weeks | Set and adjusted by the coach from a weekly Training Focus: Recovery, Maintain or Build |
| Daily load | Adds up through the week, so a light day can be made up later | Same |

So on free, your target drifts along behind what you have been doing. If you train harder for a month, the target creeps up to match. On Premium, the coach chooses a direction and the target follows the choice. Neither is wrong. If you wanted the app to push you towards a goal, that is the thing you'd miss. If you just wanted a rough weekly guide, the free version is that.

(Google's page also says the first target appears after 7 consecutive days of wear in one place and after two weeks in another. It doesn't reconcile them.)

## What you won't miss unless you used it

Be honest about your own habits. A list of questions to ask yourself:

- Did I open the coach more than twice a month? If not, you'd lose nothing.
- Did I follow an adaptive plan, or choose my own workouts? Plans only matter if you follow them.
- Did I read the extra sleep insights, or only the score? The score and its parts are free.
- Do I rely on the weekly target to decide how hard to train?

If the answer to all four is no, the subscription would be paying for features you'd looked at once.

## What Premium doesn't give you

Premium doesn't change the data the watch collects, and it doesn't add the recovery or strain figures people sometimes expect from a subscription band. Google's scores are Readiness (a 0-100 figure, with 65 and above counted as High), Cardio Load and the Sleep Score. There's no Strain on a 0-21 scale and no morning Recovery percentage. If you want those without a subscription, [Pulse](/) is a free app you host yourself that computes them from the same Google Health data; it needs Docker and your own Google Cloud project, and it's built and tested with a Fitbit Air only. There's a fuller side-by-side on the [Google Health Premium comparison page](/compare/google-health-premium/).

## A sensible way to decide

Don't decide on day 91. During the last weeks of the trial, notice whether you actually open the coach or the extra sleep insights. If you can't remember doing it, let the trial lapse and see what the free app feels like. Google's pages don't say what happens to your history if you stop paying, so check that in the app before you rely on it.
