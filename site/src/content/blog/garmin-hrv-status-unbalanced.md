"Unbalanced" means your seven-day average HRV has moved outside your personal baseline range, either above it or below it. It is an orange warning that something has shifted, not a diagnosis. Garmin's own manual says it may point to fatigue, greater recovery needs or more stress, and often it just means you trained harder than usual.

## What the status is comparing

Garmin's manuals are specific about the mechanics. The watch measures the gaps between heartbeats from your wrist while you sleep. It then takes a seven-day average and compares that with a baseline range built from your own history. The manual lists four statuses:

| Status | Colour | What the manual says |
|---|---|---|
| Balanced | Green | Seven-day average is within your baseline range |
| Unbalanced | Orange | Seven-day average is above or below your baseline range |
| Low | Red | Seven-day average is well below your baseline range |
| Poor | None | Averaging well below the normal range for your age |

There is also "No status" when the watch lacks enough data for a seven-day average.

```sketch
{"kind": "flow", "alt": "Overnight heartbeat gaps become a seven-day average, which Garmin compares with a personal baseline range to give an HRV status.", "inputs": ["Gaps between heartbeats, overnight", "Seven-day average", {"label": "Your baseline range", "note": "about 3 weeks of data"}], "output": "HRV status: Balanced, Unbalanced, Low or Poor", "caption": "Mechanics from Garmin's owner's manual."}
```

Two points people miss. First, the comparison is between a week and a range, not between last night and last night's number. A single awful night barely dents a seven-day average. Second, Unbalanced is a two-sided label. The label alone doesn't say which side you're on, so open the chart in Garmin Connect to see where the average sits against the shaded band.

```sketch
{"kind": "line", "alt": "A seven-day HRV average that stays inside a shaded baseline band, then leaves it above, and later drops below it.", "yLabel": "Seven-day average", "series": [{"label": "Seven-day average", "points": [50, 52, 49, 51, 58, 66, 68, 60, 52, 46, 38, 33], "tone": "blue"}], "band": {"from": 44, "to": 58, "label": "Your baseline range"}, "notes": [{"at": 6, "text": "Above: Unbalanced"}, {"at": 11, "text": "Below: Unbalanced"}], "caption": "Illustration, not real data."}
```

## Why above the range counts too

It feels odd to be told off for higher-than-usual HRV, since higher is usually the direction people want. Garmin's blog addresses it directly: if you ramp up training a lot, your status can land above your baseline range, and it says this "may seem like a good thing" but means your body is working to recover. I'm reporting that from the blog as quoted in search results, and the manual itself only says "above or below".

There is also a statistical reason that a one-sided rule would be a poor fit. A baseline range is built from your own history, so anything well outside it, in either direction, is simply unusual for you. Whether unusual is good or bad depends on context, which is why Garmin pairs the status with advice to look at sleep, Body Battery, Training Readiness and how you feel rather than acting on HRV alone.

## How the baseline is built

Garmin says the watch needs about three weeks of consistent sleep data before it will show a status at all. After that the baseline is dynamic. Garmin's material notes your normal range may be lower after an extended period of training than in a period of little training or peak condition, and one Garmin forum post quoting Support says the baseline adapts slowly on purpose. I'd treat that last point as a user report.

A reset or new watch starts the three-week clock again, so a new device that says Unbalanced in its first month is mostly telling you it is still learning you.

## Common reasons for Unbalanced

Garmin's blog lists training too hard, poor sleep, stress, a change in activity, not meeting nutritional needs and "a cocktail or two" among the things that can push HRV below baseline. In practice, check these in order:

1. **A recent jump in training.** A new block, a race or a week of unusual volume is the classic cause, in either direction.
2. **Short or broken sleep.** HRV is measured overnight, so bad nights show up in it directly.
3. **Alcohol or a late meal.** For some people a couple of drinks can lower the following morning's HRV by 10 ms or more. That is a personal response and Garmin gives no figure.
4. **Illness coming on.** A lower HRV is often one of the early signs. I found no Garmin guidance that ties illness to the status specifically, so this comes from general physiology, not from the manual.
5. **A wear problem.** If the watch was loose, on the wrong wrist position, or not worn for several nights, the average has fewer data points.

## How long should you worry?

A day or two outside the range after a hard week is normal. The more useful signal is persistence: an Unbalanced status that lasts a couple of weeks, with training steady and sleep decent, deserves a closer look at your habits. HRV research on athletes tends to rely on averages over several days for the same reason. Plews and colleagues' work on elite endurance athletes ([Sports Medicine, 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s40279-013-0071-8)) is an example of this approach, with weekly averages of log-transformed rMSSD, though I couldn't read the full text to quote specifics.

If your status is Low or Poor and you also feel unwell, have a resting heart rate well above normal, or notice symptoms such as chest discomfort or fainting, see a doctor. A watch can't tell you what is going on.

## What to do

- Look at the seven-day average against the band in Garmin Connect before reacting.
- If it's above the band after a big training week, do what Garmin suggests: allow more recovery.
- If it's below, work through sleep, alcohol, stress and illness first.
- Wear the watch every night so the baseline stays honest.
- Don't compare your ms values with anyone else's. The manual itself says normal HRV varies widely by sex, age and fitness level, and [what is a good HRV by age](/blog/good-hrv-by-age/) explains why your own baseline matters more than a table.

Training Readiness uses HRV status as one of its inputs, so a stubborn Unbalanced can explain a low score there ([Garmin Training Readiness always low](/blog/garmin-training-readiness-always-low/)). Body Battery also leans on heart rate variability ([what is a good Body Battery?](/blog/good-body-battery/)).

## A Fitbit or Pulse version

Fitbit Air users get HRV in the Google Health app too, but not a Balanced or Unbalanced label. Pulse, a free app you host yourself, reads the nightly HRV from your Google Health data and shows it against your own baseline ([how HRV is used](/metrics/hrv/)). Its Health Monitor flags a vital as elevated or low when it leaves a range of your usual night-to-night swings, which is the same basic idea with different thresholds. It has been tested on the Fitbit Air only, and it is not a replacement for Garmin's status.
