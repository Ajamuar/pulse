If you want a WHOOP-type band without paying every year, there are now several real options. As of October 2026 the main ones are Google's Fitbit Air ($99.99), the Amazfit Helio Strap ($99.99), the Polar Loop (about $180-200), Garmin's Cirqa ($199.99) and an Apple Watch with an app such as Bevel or Athlytic.

This list was checked on 9 October 2026. Prices move, and several of these companies sell an optional paid tier, so I note that for each. None of them is a copy of WHOOP, and none will give you WHOOP's exact scores, which are not published.

## At a glance

| Option | Hardware price (US, Oct 2026) | Subscription | Screen |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fitbit Air + Google Health | $99.99 | Optional Google Health Premium, $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year | None |
| Amazfit Helio Strap | $99.99 | Optional Aura, $69.99 a year | None |
| Polar Loop | $179.90-199.90, varies by region | None required | None |
| Garmin Cirqa | $199.99 | None required; optional Connect+ | None |
| Apple Watch + Bevel or Athlytic | Apple Watch price not checked | Bevel has a free tier, Pro about $99.99 a year; Athlytic about $30 a year (both reported by third parties) | Yes |
| Pulse (software only) | Needs a Fitbit Air | Free | None |

For comparison, WHOOP itself is $199 (One), $239 (Peak) or $359 (Life) a year in the US with the band included. Prices come from third-party price trackers because whoop.com could not be read directly.

## Fitbit Air with Google Health

Google launched the Fitbit Air in May 2026 at $99.99. It is a screenless band, and reports on launch say it works without a subscription; every purchase includes three months of Google Health Premium. Premium is $9.99 a month or $99.99 a year, and it is where Google's Health Coach and some extra insights live ([what you lose without Premium](/blog/google-health-premium-vs-free/)).

**Suits:** someone who wants the cheapest screenless hardware from a large company, in the Android and iPhone ecosystem, and is happy with Google's own scores. **Be aware:** the exact free-versus-paid split is the thing to check before buying.

## Amazfit Helio Strap

At launch the Helio Strap was $99.99, and Amazfit markets it as subscription-free. Its recovery feature is called BioCharge. Reviewers describe an optional Aura service at $69.99 a year with an AI advisor and audio content. Android Authority's review criticised heart-rate accuracy and automatic workout detection; Tom's Guide found sleep tracking accurate.

**Suits:** budget buyers who want a recovery-style number and can live with some noisy data. **Be aware:** accuracy complaints are in the reviews, so read them.

## Polar Loop

Polar describes the Loop as its first screen-free, subscription-free wearable: a one-off purchase with every feature available from day one. Launch prices reported are $179.90 (TechRadar) or $199.90 (GSMArena), and around 180 euros in Germany. Battery life is up to about 8 days, and you read your data in the free Polar Flow app. Heise reports that Polar also offers an optional paid training-plan service at just under 10 euros a month.

**Suits:** people who already use Polar for training and want a band for sleep and daily recovery without a screen.

## Garmin Cirqa

Garmin's Cirqa launched in July 2026 at $199.99 with no screen, no required subscription for core health and fitness features, and about 10 days of battery. It has no built-in GPS, so outdoor distance needs your phone. Garmin Connect+ is an optional paid tier that holds selected coaching and AI features.

**Suits:** existing Garmin users, or anyone who wants Body Battery and Garmin's training metrics in a band. **Be aware:** it is the most expensive hardware here.

## Apple Watch with Bevel or Athlytic

If you already own an Apple Watch you may need no new hardware. Bevel's free tier includes daily recovery, sleep, strain, stress and Energy Bank scores; its Pro plan is reported at $99.99 a year. Athlytic is free to download with in-app purchases, reportedly around $30 a year. I could only confirm both prices through third-party pages, so check the App Store in your region. Both lean on the Watch's HRV and resting heart rate.

**Suits:** iPhone users who already wear an Apple Watch. Note that an apps-only route still has a subscription for the extras.

## Pulse, if you have a Fitbit Air

Pulse is free software (source-available under PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0, not an OSI open-source licence) that you host yourself in Docker. It reads the data your Fitbit Air syncs to Google Health and computes its own Recovery, Strain, Sleep Performance and more, with the formulas published ([how Recovery works](/metrics/recovery/)). It needs a Google Cloud project and OAuth client of your own, so it is not a one-click install. It has been tested on the Fitbit Air only. Other devices that sync to Google Health send the same data types but have not been tested. See also [recovery tracking without a subscription](/compare/recovery-tracking-without-subscription/) and [Pulse against subscription wearables](/compare/pulse-vs-subscription-wearables/).

**Suits:** people comfortable running a small server who want their scores and their data on their own machine.

## How to choose

Start with what you already own. An Apple Watch owner has the cheapest path. If you are buying hardware, the two $99.99 options cost half of the Polar Loop and Garmin, and the price gap over a year matters more than any spec. Then decide whether you want the manufacturer's own app (Fitbit Air, Helio, Polar, Garmin) or a self-hosted option.

{"kind": "steps", "alt": "Four steps for choosing a WHOOP alternative, from what you already own to what the subscription buys.", "steps": [{"title": "What you own", "text": "An Apple Watch is the cheapest path."}, {"title": "Hardware price", "text": "The two $99.99 options cost half of Polar or Garmin."}, {"title": "Whose app", "text": "The maker's own app, or self-hosted."}, {"title": "What WHOOP adds", "text": "Coaching and Healthspan are what its fee buys."}]}
```

Last, remember that every one of these has a smaller ecosystem than WHOOP's membership, with its coaching and features like Healthspan. If those are what you want, the subscription is what you are paying for.
