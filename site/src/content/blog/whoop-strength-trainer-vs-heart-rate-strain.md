You squat heavy for an hour, feel flattened the next day, and your strain score says 8. That is not a bug. A strain score built only on heart rate measures how hard your cardiovascular system worked, and lifting taxes your muscles far more than your heart. WHOOP added muscular load to close the gap. Heart-rate-only scores, Pulse's included, cannot.

## Why heart rate misses lifting

Heart rate follows oxygen demand. Running at a steady pace keeps large muscle groups working continuously, so heart rate climbs and stays up. It is a decent proxy for the whole effort.

A strength session looks different. A set of five heavy reps lasts perhaps 20 seconds. Then you rest for two or three minutes while your heart rate drops back. Averaged over an hour, the heart spends much of the time at light-to-moderate levels, even though each set was close to your limit. Heart rate also rises for reasons that have little to do with muscle fatigue: breath holding on a heavy rep, caffeine, a hot gym.

The result is a gap between how a session feels and what a zone-based score records. The mismatch is largest for low-rep heavy work and smallest for circuits with short rests, where the heart really does stay high. A sprint session and a deadlift session can leave you equally tired, while only the first looks large on a heart rate chart.

## How WHOOP adds muscular load

WHOOP's Day Strain is on a 0-21 logarithmic scale. WHOOP says it combines cardiovascular load, from time in your personal heart-rate zones, with muscular load. Its support material describes three levels of input for muscular load:

1. **Automatic estimate.** For activities such as weightlifting, functional fitness or HIIT, WHOOP estimates muscular strain from the activity type and duration, using patterns from many logged Strength Trainer sessions. Because duration drives it, a longer easy session can show more muscular strain than a shorter hard one.
2. **Tagging exercises afterwards.** You pick the movements you did, and WHOOP refines the estimate using factors such as which muscle groups were involved.
3. **Logging sets, reps and weight live.** WHOOP says it uses the strap's accelerometer and gyroscope to measure each rep's speed and intensity, combined with your logged exercises. Over time it learns your baselines.

A WHOOP staff reply in its community forum says the calculation rests on total volume (sets x reps x weight), intensity and exercise type, and that splitting the same total into different set structures gives a similar result. That is a forum answer, not a specification. WHOOP does not publish the formula, the weights, or how cardiovascular and muscular parts are combined beyond saying it is non-linear.

Two honest observations follow from this. First, the most accurate mode needs effort: you have to log the workout. Second, since the formula is private, you cannot check why a given session scored what it did. It is a reasonable idea, but one you have to take on trust.

## What the numbers do to your recovery picture

If strain drives your Recovery interpretation, as it does for many people, a missing muscular component distorts the story. Imagine two days with the same cardiovascular strain, one a long easy ride, the other heavy lower-body lifting. The second leaves you more sore and may depress next-morning HRV, yet a heart-rate-only score treats them as equals. You might read a "low-strain" week as light and wonder why you feel flat.

Delayed soreness and the cost to your nervous system also arrive later, often one or two days after the session. That timing is a further reason a same-day score from heart rate struggles to represent lifting.

## Where Pulse stands

Pulse, a free app you host yourself, computes a 0-21 Strain from your heart rate alone, using the same five heart-rate-reserve zones as its zone chart ([how Strain works](/metrics/strain/)). It has no muscular load. Its own documentation says heart rate misses effort that barely raises it, such as heavy lifting with long rests. So a lifting session will usually read low in Pulse, and the number should not be used to judge how hard a strength day was. Pulse is also built and tested with the Fitbit Air only.

There is a partial counterweight elsewhere. Pulse Age counts weekly strength minutes from exercises logged with a strength type, so lifting is recognised there ([how Pulse Age works](/metrics/pulse-age/)). That is a long-term habit measure, not a measure of one day's load.

## Working around heart-rate-only strain

None of this requires abandoning a heart-rate score. You just need to read it differently on lifting days.

- **Keep a separate note for strength work.** Session RPE (rate of perceived exertion, 1-10, multiplied by minutes) is a long-established method for tracking training load without a sensor. A line in a notebook is enough.
- **Compare like with like.** If you lift on Mondays and Thursdays, compare those days with each other. Don't compare a lifting day's strain with a cycling day's.
- **Watch the next morning.** HRV and resting heart rate the day after are often a better signal of how costly the lifting was than the strain number. Look for several nights, not one.
- **Add a conditioning finisher only if you want one.** Short rests and circuits raise heart rate and will register. Don't change your training to please a score.
- **Trust how you feel over the score** on heavy days. A strain figure is a summary of heart rate, not of your muscles.

## How much does it matter?

If most of your training is running, cycling or rowing, heart-rate strain is a fair summary and the gap is small. If you lift three or four times a week, it matters, and a score that includes any muscular component, WHOOP's or another, is closer to the truth for you. That is a real difference between products, and WHOOP deserves credit for tackling it. It still depends on how well the estimate matches your body, which only you can check against how you feel.
